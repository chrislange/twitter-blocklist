# Twitter Blocklist
Are you sick of all the spam bot Twitter accounts that follow you and comment on your tweets with garbage? Simply download and import the *twitter-blocklist.csv* to block some of the common spam accounts that have yet to be taken down by Twitter.

## How to import the list
Please refer to the [Twitter documentation](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-block-options) for help with importing the list.

## Contribution
While I'd love to open this up for contribution from other users I'm not going to at this point as it could easily lead to abuse of the list. However, that being said if there is an account or accounts you want to flag, just @ or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crslng).
